**Topic:** IT vs OT Security Priorities
- Learned that OT prioritizes Availability (AIC) over Confidentiality (CIA).

### Research Note: Cybiant Article (CIA vs AIC)
- **IT Focus:** Confidentiality is King. Protect the data (e.g., banking).
- **OT Focus:** Availability is King. Protect the process (e.g., water treatment).
- **Key Difference:** In OT, we cannot simply 'lock down' a system if it means stopping the safety controls.
